Phase 1 :
Public speaking is very easy.

Phase 2 :

0x08048b63 <+27>:	cmp    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x18],0x1

First number need to be 1.

After this there is a loop for the 5 remaining number.

First cmp => n == $eax(2)
second cmp => n == $eax(6)
three => n == $eax (24)
four => n == $eax (120)
five => n == $eax (720)

1 2 6 24 120
